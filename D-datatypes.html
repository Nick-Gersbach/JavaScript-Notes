  <h1>JavaScript Datatypes</h1>
  <!-- Notes 
  THERE ARE 2 MAIN DATA TYPES IN JS

  1. Primitive Data Types
  2. Refernece Data Types

  PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
  - Stored directly in the location the variable accesses
  - Stored on the Stack

  6 types of primitive data types

  1. String - text or numbers that are in quotes
  2. Numbers - 12345 - not in quotes
  3. Boolean - True or False
  4. Null - Empty Value
  5. Undefined - Variable without a value assigned
  6. Symbols (ES6) - Learn more about them later

   REFERENCE DATA TYPES

  - Accessed by reference
  - Objects that are stored on the heap
  - A pointer to a loacation in memory

  Examples - 

  - Arrays
  - Object Literals
  - Functions
  - Dates
  - Anything else...

  - All reference data types will come back as objects. They are not accessed by thier actual value, but by references.

  JS IS A DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE WHICH MEANS...

  - Data types are associated with values not variables
  
  - The same variable can hold multiple data types. This means that a variable can hold a string and later be reassigned to a number without issue. Most other programming languages do not allow this.

  - There are subsets (different dialects) of JS that turn it into a statically typed language like Java and C#. Examples are typescript.

  <script>
//Checking data types with typeof

//Primitive Data Types

//String
const name = 'Nick';
console.log(typeof name);

//Number
const age = 29;
console.log(typeof age);

//Boolean
const hasKids = true;
console.log(typeof hasKids);


//Null
const car = null;
console.log(typeof car);
//Not really an object. This is a bug is js.


//Undefined
let test;
console.log(typeof test);

//Symbol
const sym = Symbol();
console.log(typeof sym);

//REFERENCE TYPES

//Array
const hobbies = ['movies', 'music', 'videogames'];
console.log(typeof hobbies);

//Object Literal
const address = {
  city: 'Chandler',
  state: 'Arizona'
}

console.log(typeof address);

//Date 
const today = new Date();
console.log(today);
console.log(typeof today);
