  <h1>JS Loops</h1>
  <!-- Notes
  - A loop is an instruction that repeats until a specific condition is reached.

  - Loops allow you to run the same block of code using different values each time.

  - The 3 most used loops are for loops, while loops, and do while loops

  - You'll always need to use var or let when working with loops

  - i and x are most commonly used in loops, but you can use anything

  - When it comes to what type of loop you use, it's mostly personal preference. However, nerds say to use a for loop when you know how many times (iterations) a loop is going to run, and use a while loop when you aren't sure

  FOR LOOPS

  - These loops take in 3 parameters that are seperated by ;
  - i++ means i = i +1;

  for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

  Example - This for loop example means that...
  1. i = 0 (let i = 0)
  2. As long as i is less than 10 (i < 10)
  3. Add one to i (i++)
  4 When 10 is reached the loop will stop


WHILE LOOP
- In while loops you only out one condition in the () and everyhting else that you want to do goes in the {}
let i = 0;

while(i < 10) {
console.log('Number ' + i)
i++;
}

DO WHILE LOOP

- The main difference with do while loops is that they are going to run at least once, no matter what.

let i = 0;

do {
  console.log('Number ' + i)
  i++
}

while(i < 10);
   -->
   <script>
   //FOR LOOP
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log('Number ' + i);
}

//Adding another condition to our for loop with if/else
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if(i===2) {
    console.log('2 is my favorite number!')
    continue; //This gets rid of number 2 and replaces it with the string
  }
  console.log('Number ' + i);
}

//Breaking out of a loop with break;
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if(i===2) {
    console.log('2 is my favorite number!')
    continue; //This gets rid of number 2 and replaces it with the string
  }
  if(i ===5) {
    console.log('Stop the loop!');
    break;
  }
  console.log('Number ' + i);
}

//WHILE LOOP
let i = 0;

while(i < 10) {
console.log('Number ' + i)
i++;
}

//DO WHILE LOOP
 i = 0;

do {
  console.log('Number ' + i)
  i++
}

while(i < 10);

//Looping through arrays (This is not recommended but it is possible. You should use built in array methods to loop through arrays instead)

const cars = ['BMW', 'Chevy', 'Ford', 'Dodge', 'Audi'];

for (let x = 0; x < cars.length; x++) {
  console.log(cars[x]);
}

//FOR EACH ARRAY LOOP (This does the same thing as the array loop above, but it used the build array method forEach which allows us to write a lot less code)

cars.forEach(function(car){
  console.log(car);
});

//Map Method - This is usually used to return a different array
const users = [
  {id:1, name:'Nick'},
  {id:2, name:'Bill'},
  {id:3, name:'John'},
  {id:4, name:'Buck'},
]

const ids = users.map(function(user){
  return user.id;
});

console.log(ids);

//FOR IN LOOP (This is how you loop through an object and get key value pairs)

const user = {
  firstName: 'Nick',
  lastName: 'G',
  age: 29
}

for (let x in user) {
  console.log(`${x} : ${user[x]}`);
}
